# Breast Cancer Detection

![image.jpg](can3.jpg)
- Cancer Detection is a one of the most resarched topic in not only in field of Medicine but also in Instrument technology and machine learning.
- Among all types of cancer breast cancer has the maximum share.
- With increase in unhealtty lifesytle and polluting envioronment it has been more important than ever to study and diagnose.
- Despite efforts on part of various agenices many lifes are lost to the deadly cause.<br>

According to WHO there are about 1.38 million new cases and 458 000 deaths from breast cancer each year (IARC Globocan, 2008)

## Methodlogy of Data Collection

- The methodlogy used to collect data is Fine-needle aspiration (FNA). FNA is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or masses. In this technique, a thin (23â€“25 gauge), hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells that, after being stained, will be examined under a microscope (biopsy).
- Fine-needle aspiration biopsies are very safe minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead, eliminating the need for hospitalization. In 1981, the first fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the United States was done at Maimonides Medical Center.[1] Today, this procedure is widely used in the diagnosis of cancer and inflammatory conditions

## Classification Problem

- In Machine learning the output of detection for any disease is considered in binary format, i.e With the given data set/input data of subject/patient will infected with the given disease or not. 
- The given data or the input data is nothing but the test results that are conducted while examining the patient.
